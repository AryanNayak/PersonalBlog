                    <b>1. Burn the bridges behind you</b>
                    
                    <br>    
                    <br>
                    <blockquote>
                        “A man regrets upon his act of sin after accomplishing it. If the same wisdom is shown before doing the action then the man will definitely attain Nirvana”.
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    The greatest enemy is the regret of the past. We must never regret the things we have done in the past, rather accept them and dissolve them forever. Owning up to your mistakes and accepting them is the most thoughtful thing you can do for yourself.

                    <b>2. Eliminate the unnecessary</b>
                    In life, it is extremely important to choose the things you “do not do”, rather than the things you “do”. Filling up your plate with too many unnecessary things is only going to harm your wildly important goal. It’s extremely important to be aware of the things you care about and value. Always stick to the goals you want to achieve rather than saying yes to what the world wants you to achieve.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>3. Walkout unemotionally</b>
                    Suppressing your views in life only leads to a bigger breakdown for you in the future. It’s better to walk out when you feel it’s wrong because if you don’t stand up for yourself then no one is going to do it for you. Walking out is not a sign of cowardness rather a sign of self-awareness. Freedom is only when you listen to yourself and not act on your emotional impulses.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>4. Communicate well</b>
                    It’s only the words that inspire us or break us. Speaking our mind out loud is the most valuable skill that determines our success. Chanakya says,
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <blockquote>
                        “Build the best communications skills and be the greatest at working with teams these are the two factors that will make you succeed in life”
                    </blockquote>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>5. Chase wealth</b>
                    Wealth is defined by the person’s character and personality rather than the external materialism which is a byproduct of the former. Our levels of success will rarely exceed our level of character because success is something we attract by who we become. Thus, channelizing our energy towards our internal wealth is what is going to result in exterior wealth.
