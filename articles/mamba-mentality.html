                    Mamba mentality is not just a life philosophy but a way of life. It simply means being the best version of yourself, doing your work with the best of your ability, and getting better at it every day.

                    Mamba Mentality is an alter ego that Kobe Bryant developed during a crisis period of his life when he didn't know where he was going. We all might've been at this place once in our lifetime where we don't know what we are doing or where we are going. At this point, it's important to take yourself out of your world and think about questions like: What would get me excited every day to get up? What would I love to do every day?

                    After you figure out these questions, it's time to be a Mamba. When you reach this hyper-focused state, your efforts start showing results, and that's the breakthrough.

                    Many people fall into a dilemma of whether they are doing the right things in life or not. At this moment, all you can do is be the best at whatever you are doing and be the coldest mamba ever. This will lead to clarity in your goals and give you more opportunities ahead.

                    According to the 40% rule coined by David Goggins, "When your mind is telling you you're done, you're only 40 percent done." Challenge yourself to dig deeper and to ignore the mental limits you place on yourself as you travel the road ahead. We all are stronger than we think we are; it's all about the kind of mindset we have toward our goal.

                    It is also about the purity of your dreams. Don't let the world attach anything to you that will destroy your dreams. As Will Smith said in his movie The Pursuit of Happyness, "You got a dream, you gotta protect it."

                    You also need to realize it's not only about you. No matter how hard you try to be the best, there's always going to be debate about who is the G.O.A.T (Greatest of all time). It's important for you to compete with yourself to reach your ultimate potential so that you can inspire others to work as hard as you.

                <blockquote>
                    "Those times when you get up early and you work hard, those times when you stay up late and you work hard, those times when you don't feel like working, you're too tired, you don't want to push yourself, but you do it anyway. That is actually the dream. That's the dream. It's not the destination, it's the journey. And if you guys can understand that, then what you'll see happen is you won't accomplish your dreams, your dreams won't come true; something greater will." - Kobe Bryant
