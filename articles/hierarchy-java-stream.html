                <p>
                    When we write code for java streams, we take a source, apply intermediate operations to it, and add a terminal operation.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    These intermediate operations can be filtering out even elements, sorting all the elements or having distinct elements.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In the terminal operations, you can have operations like the sum/average of all the elements or simply adding the items in a collection.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Using stream makes the code clean, readable and also efficient due to lazy evaluation. It creates a pipeline of functions where all the elements go through these functions in one go. This pipeline does not have any storage, it's only an abstraction over the given source.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Hierarchy of streams:</h3>
                
                <p>
                    There are mainly 5 interfaces of streams:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>BaseStream</strong>: It provides methods like parallel(), sequential() and unordered().</li>
                    <li><strong>IntStream</strong>: It is used for streams of primitive int.</li>
                    <li><strong>LongStream</strong>: It is used for streams of primitive long.</li>
                    <li><strong>DoubleStream</strong>: It is used for streams of primitive double.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stream&lt;T&gt;</strong>: It is used for non-primitives.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    Some common methods of all these interfaces are:
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>filter()</strong>: It is an intermediate operation, that takes a predicate as an argument and filters out the element according to the given predicate.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>sorted()</strong>: It is an intermediate operation, that takes a stream and returns the sorted version of that stream.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>forEach()</strong>: It is a terminal method and takes an action as an argument, and performs the given action on each element of the stream.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>findFirst()</strong>: It is a terminal operation that is used to find the first element of the stream.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>collect()</strong>: It is a terminal operation that is used to convert a stream into a collection. (for example, if you want to get the data in a collection like an ArrayList, you can use the collect() method)
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The below methods are available only in IntStream, LongStream and DoubleStream:
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>sum()</strong>: It is used to get the sum of all the elements in the stream.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>average()</strong>: It is used to get the average of all the elements in the stream.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>boxed()</strong>: It is used to create a stream which is a non-primitive stream. (for example Long or Integer)
