                    Think about the last thing you did yesterday which made you feel satisfied or think about the last successful thing you did this year?

                <p>
                    All of these things that you've achieved have always required less time than you might've thought they would've needed. This is the key to getting more things done in a restricted amount of time.

                    Every day we spend our time as if we are immortals on this planet. We all have a limited amount of time which is given to us every day to work for the world. Understanding this emergency is the wisest thing any human can do. We spend our only valuable resource, time on unnecessary and unimportant things which don't matter to us at all. As Bob Dylan said,

                <blockquote>
                    "He not busy being born is busy dying."
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>
                    Stoics believe that every day we wake up to work for the world and we must perform our work to leave the world better than it was yesterday. We must accept that all of us are working for the world directly or indirectly, knowingly or unknowingly. So accepting that if it were your last day on earth what is the most important thing you would do to be remembered by this world and act according to it.

                    In Hinduism, it is believed that mortality is the only truth there is in the physical world. Thus accepting that we won't be here forever and understanding the emergency is the way to get your most important thing done every day.

                    Simulating these emergencies of your mortality in your life is the way to get your best work out in the world and focus on your wildly important goals in your life. Just like how I am writing this blog, it didn't take me so long to write it but the thought of doing it invites laziness, always remember to do the action and act on to things rather than spending most of your time thinking about it.
