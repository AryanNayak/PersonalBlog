                    A man wanted to climb to the peak of a mountain. He decides to ask a few people living, near the area of the mountain, the easiest path to the peak. After knowing the path, he starts to follow the way guided by the natives. After reaching a few distances, he found a traveler who was returning from the climb. He asks him the same question, "Traveller, what is the easiest path to reach the top of the mountain?". After knowing the path guided by this traveler, man changes his started path and follows another way to reach the peak.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    As he starts following this path, he meets more travelers and he asks them the same question. After following all the ways guided by all of these travelers, he stops and decides to not climb the mountain. He is convinced by all the travelers about the description of the peak and the ways to reach it. He starts to climb down.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    When he was returning down, he found a few other travelers who were trying to reach the ultimate top of the mountain. They ask him the same question, and now the man answers them all the paths that were told to him by the other travelers while he was climbing up the mountain. Neither did he reach the top, nor did he know the right way to reach the top.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In our life too in the quest to reach the peak of our goals, we forget to self-discover our ways. We fall into the designed patterns given by others, we fall into words like, "If you follow this thing, then you can certainly achieve your goals". But we all are unique in our ways and that's what makes our paths also unique.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    We are never going to find satisfaction in following a way designed or planned out by others, it's the journey of self-discovery that brings the most freedom to our spirit. This journey is not decided by how others have done it, it's decided by how we do it. That's the reason why any kind of art form sets us free, from the rules and laws designed by other people.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    If only we start to follow our path, we can find the peace within and find the inner freedom.
