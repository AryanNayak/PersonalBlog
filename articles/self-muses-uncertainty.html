                    I'm a bit rusted since I have not written any blog for a long time. I realised the past few months and as well as years have been filled with uncertainty, but what I am astonished by is, however, dreadful those situations might look, all of us are dealing with them and sailing through the tough situations.

                    But as a species/generation, we are becoming stronger and mentally resilient towards uncertainty, pushing our body, mind and soul to the limit.

                    Stoicism talks about how the world's true nature itself is insecurity and trying to chase security in our life is a false goal, chasing that peak of success makes you fear losing it all.

                <p>
                    Focusing on the present and embracing uncertainty is what makes us at peace with ourselves and nature.

                    Stoicism is not to avoid the feelings you currently have, but it is a mental model to help us avoid being destroyed by life.

                    It is easier said than doing it, but once you understand that everything around is temporary and it shall pass, things are going to go well for you as well as bad, maintaining your inner peace through the troughs and peaks is what the aim should be.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Wishing that I don't get sick, that I don't get laid off or that no bad thing happens to me, is a foolish idea, but embracing the uncertainty and maintaining your inner peace through the bad times is what makes us push through.
