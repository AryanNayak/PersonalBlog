                <p>

                <p>
                    I recently came across George Mack’s work on high agency, and I found his mental model for solving
                    problems incredibly helpful.

                    Usually, we think that a lot of problems are unsolvable. But that’s exactly when we should ask
                    ourselves questions like:
                </p>

                1. Does this problem defy the laws of physics?
                <br>
                <br>
                2. If not, what is the least-effort step I can take to start solving the problem?
                <br>
                <br>

                <p>
                    Momentum breeds action. I am always inspired when I see some progress; usually, that sense of
                    progress empowers us to do more.

                    As Rumi said:

                <blockquote>
                    “As you walk, the way starts to appear.”
                </blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The video game industry excels at this—they break down challenges so they aren’t overwhelming, yet
                    they remain just challenging enough to make you addicted to progress.

                    The mental model to solve any overwhelming problem would be:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>List the high-level problem statement.</li>
                    <li>Write out the levels for it.</li>
                    <li>Identify the least amount of effort required to get started.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For example, let’s say I want to become an expert in the Python programming language:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Level 1: Write down everything you can do to become an expert in Python.</li>
                    <li>Level 2: Pick the top thing from the list that you can start doing now.</li>
                    <li>Level 3: Ask ChatGPT to create a plan for the top pick.</li>
                    <li>Level 4: Read the first three blogs on that topic.</li>
                    <li>Level 5: Go to the next top thing from Level 2 and repeat Levels 3 and 4.</li>
                    <br>
                    High agency is about taking an overwhelming problem and breaking it down into simple, achievable
                    steps that don’t require you to be the smartest person in the room.

                </p>

                <p>
                    As George puts it:
                <blockquote>
                    High agency is like a spark—a je ne sais quoi. It’s bias for action in real flesh.
                </blockquote>


                <p>
                    In fact, the three pillars of high agency are:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1. Bias for action
                    <br>
                    2. Disagreeability
                    <br>
                    3. Clear thinking
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This approach has changed how I view and tackle overwhelming problems.
